This is an application to track your personal finances!
 
With it you(or will be able to in the near future):
 
- add different types of accounts: bank, loans, credit cards
- create categories that can have parent categories
- create tags
- using the iphone interface know the gps position of where you spend your money
- share an account with your spouse/girlfriend/friend/son/daughter/dog/cat or with whoever else
- plot the speding or see in a map where your dangerous spending areas are
- have recurring items
- transfer money from one account to the other
- have goals and see how you are doing
- anything else that is needed
 
 
This depends on:
- geokit 1.5.0
- authlogic
- postgres (just because of the foreign keys, but i haven't tested it with any other database, so it might work)
There are two files that need to be edited:
 
- config/database.example should be changed to database.yml with your database information
- config/initializers/mailer.example if you want to send mail through an account in gmail. if you aren't going to do that, you'll probably need some other configuration
 
 
you can see this code live in:
